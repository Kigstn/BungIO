    Tip: Manifest Information
        This model has some attributes which can be filled with additional information found in the manifest (`manifest_...`).
        Without additional work, these attributes will be `None`, since they require additional requests and database lookups.

        To fill the manifest dependent attributes, either:

        - Run `await ThisClass.fetch_manifest_information()`, see [here](/API Reference/Models/base)
        - Set `Client.always_return_manifest_information` to `True`, see [here](/API Reference/client)

    Attributes:
        category: Category for the stat.
        group: Statistic group
        icon_image: Optional URI to an icon for the statistic
        medal_tier_hash: The tier associated with this medal - be it implicitly or explicitly.
        merge_method: Optional icon for the statistic
        modes: Game modes where this statistic can be reported.
        period_types: Time periods the statistic covers
        stat_description: Description of a stat if applicable.
        stat_id: Unique programmer friendly ID for this stat
        stat_name: Display name
        stat_name_abbr: Display name abbreviated
        unit_label: Localized Unit Name for the stat.
        unit_type: Unit, if any, for the statistic
        weight: Weight assigned to this stat indicating its relative impressiveness.

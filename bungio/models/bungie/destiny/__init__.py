    Information about a current character's status with a Progression. A progression is a value that can increase with activity and has levels. Think Character Level and Reputation Levels. Combine this "live" data with the related DestinyProgressionDefinition for a full picture of the Progression.

    Tip: Manifest Information
        This model has some attributes which can be filled with additional information found in the manifest (`manifest_...`).
        Without additional work, these attributes will be `None`, since they require additional requests and database lookups.

        To fill the manifest dependent attributes, either:

        - Run `await ThisClass.fetch_manifest_information()`, see [here](/API Reference/Models/base)
        - Set `Client.always_return_manifest_information` to `True`, see [here](/API Reference/client)

    Attributes:
        current_progress: This is the total amount of progress obtained overall for this progression (for instance, the total amount of Character Level experience earned)
        current_reset_count: The number of resets of this progression you've executed this season, if applicable to this progression.
        daily_limit: If this progression has a daily limit, this is that limit.
        daily_progress: The amount of progress earned today for this progression.
        level: This is the level of the progression (for instance, the Character Level).
        level_cap: This is the maximum possible level you can achieve for this progression (for example, the maximum character level obtainable)
        next_level_at: The total amount of progression (i.e. "Experience") needed in order to reach the next level.
        progress_to_next_level: The amount of progression (i.e. "Experience") needed to reach the next level of this Progression. Jeez, progression is such an overloaded word.
        progression_hash: The hash identifier of the Progression in question. Use it to look up the DestinyProgressionDefinition in static data.
        reward_item_states: Information about historical rewards for this progression, if there is any data for it.
        season_resets: Information about historical resets of this progression, if there is any data for it.
        step_index: Progressions define their levels in "steps". Since the last step may be repeatable, the user may be at a higher level than the actual Step achieved in the progression. Not necessarily useful, but potentially interesting for those cruising the API. Relate this to the "steps" property of the DestinyProgression to see which step the user is on, if you care about that. (Note that this is Content Version dependent since it refers to indexes.)
        weekly_limit: If this progression has a weekly limit, this is that limit.
        weekly_progress: The amount of progress earned toward this progression in the current week.

Meant to be combined with static DestinyActivityDefinition data for a full picture of the Activity.

    Tip: Manifest Information
        This model has some attributes which can be filled with additional information found in the manifest (`manifest_...`).
        Without additional work, these attributes will be `None`, since they require additional requests and database lookups.

        To fill the manifest dependent attributes, either:

        - Run `await ThisClass.fetch_manifest_information()`, see [here](/API Reference/Models/base)
        - Set `Client.always_return_manifest_information` to `True`, see [here](/API Reference/client)

    Attributes:
        activity_hash: The hash identifier of the Activity. Use this to look up the DestinyActivityDefinition of the activity.
        boolean_activity_options: The set of activity options for this activity, keyed by an identifier that's unique for this activity (not guaranteed to be unique between or across all activities, though should be unique for every *variant* of a given *conceptual* activity: for instance, the original D2 Raid has many variant DestinyActivityDefinitions. While other activities could potentially have the same option hashes, for any given D2 base Raid variant the hash will be unique). As a concrete example of this data, the hashes you get for Raids will correspond to the currently active "Challenge Mode". We don't have any human readable information for these, but saavy 3rd party app users could manually associate the key (a hash identifier for the "option" that is enabled/disabled) and the value (whether it's enabled or disabled presently) On our side, we don't necessarily even know what these are used for (the game designers know, but we don't), and we have no human readable data for them. In order to use them, you will have to do some experimentation.
        can_join: If true, the user is allowed to join with another Fireteam in this activity.
        can_lead: If true, the user is allowed to lead a Fireteam into this activity.
        challenges: _No description given by bungie._
        difficulty_tier: A DestinyActivityDifficultyTier enum value indicating the difficulty of the activity.
        display_level: The difficulty level of the activity, if applicable.
        is_completed: If true, we both have the ability to know that the user has completed this activity and they have completed it. Unfortunately, we can't necessarily know this for all activities. As such, this should probably only be used if you already know in advance which specific activities you wish to check.
        is_new: If true, then the activity should have a "new" indicator in the Director UI.
        is_visible: If true, the user should be able to see this activity.
        loadout_requirement_index: If returned, this is the index into the DestinyActivityDefinition's "loadouts" property, indicating the currently active loadout requirements.
        modifier_hashes: If the activity has modifiers, this will be the list of modifiers that all variants have in common. Perform lookups against DestinyActivityModifierDefinition which defines the modifier being applied to get at the modifier data. Note that, in the DestiyActivityDefinition, you will see many more modifiers than this being referred to: those are all *possible* modifiers for the activity, not the active ones.

    I see you've come to find out more about Talent Nodes. I'm so sorry. Talent Nodes are the conceptual, visual nodes that appear on Talent Grids. Talent Grids, in Destiny 1, were found on almost every instanced item: they had Nodes that could be activated to change the properties of the item. In Destiny 2, Talent Grids only exist for Builds/Subclasses, and while the basic concept is the same (Nodes can be activated once you've gained sufficient Experience on the Item, and provide effects), there are some new concepts from Destiny 1. Examine DestinyTalentGridDefinition and its subordinates for more information. This is the "Live" information for the current status of a Talent Node on a specific item. Talent Nodes have many Steps, but only one can be active at any one time: and it is the Step that determines both the visual and the game state-changing properties that the Node provides. Examine this and DestinyTalentNodeStepDefinition carefully. *IMPORTANT NOTE* Talent Nodes are, unfortunately, Content Version DEPENDENT. Though they refer to hashes for Nodes and Steps, those hashes are not guaranteed to be immutable across content versions. This is a source of great exasperation for me, but as a result anyone using Talent Grid data must ensure that the content version of their static content matches that of the server responses before showing or making decisions based on talent grid data.

        activation_grid_level: The progression level required on the Talent Grid in order to be able to activate this talent node. Talent Grids have their own Progression - similar to Character Level, but in this case it is experience related to the item itself.

        state: An DestinyTalentNodeState enum value indicating the node's state: whether it can be activated or swapped, and why not if neither can be performed.
        step_index: The currently relevant Step for the node. It is this step that has rendering data for the node and the benefits that are provided if the node is activated.

        - Run `await ThisClass.fetch_manifest_information()`, see [here](/API Reference/Models/base)

But when they do, it can be very useful to show. Even if they don't have human readable data, you might be able to infer the meaning of an unlock flag with a bit of experimentation...

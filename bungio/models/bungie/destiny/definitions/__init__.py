    A "Progression" in Destiny is best explained by an example. A Character's "Level" is a progression: it has Experience that can be earned, levels that can be gained, and is evaluated and displayed at various points in the game. A Character's "Faction Reputation" is also a progression for much the same reason. Progression is used by a variety of systems, and the definition of a Progression will generally only be useful if combining with live data (such as a character's DestinyCharacterProgressionComponent.progressions property, which holds that character's live Progression states). Fundamentally, a Progression measures your "Level" by evaluating the thresholds in its Steps (one step per level, except for the last step which can be repeated indefinitely for "Levels" that have no ceiling) against the total earned "progression points"/experience. (for simplicity purposes, we will henceforth refer to earned progression points as experience, though it need not be a mechanic that in any way resembles Experience in a traditional sense). Earned experience is calculated in a variety of ways, determined by the Progression's scope. These go from looking up a stored value to performing exceedingly obtuse calculations. This is why we provide live data in DestinyCharacterProgressionComponent.progressions, so you don't have to worry about those.

    Tip: Manifest Information
        This model has some attributes which can be filled with additional information found in the manifest (`manifest_...`).
        Without additional work, these attributes will be `None`, since they require additional requests and database lookups.

        To fill the manifest dependent attributes, either:

        - Run `await ThisClass.fetch_manifest_information()`, see [here](/API Reference/Models/base)
        - Set `Client.always_return_manifest_information` to `True`, see [here](/API Reference/client)

    Attributes:
        color: The #RGB string value for the color related to this progression, if there is one.
        display_properties: _No description given by bungie._
        faction_hash: If the value exists, this is the hash identifier for the Faction that owns this Progression. This is purely for convenience, if you're looking at a progression and want to know if and who it's related to in terms of Faction Reputation.
        hash: The unique identifier for this entity. Guaranteed to be unique for the type of entity, but not globally. When entities refer to each other in Destiny content, it is this hash that they are referring to.
        index: The index of the entity as it was found in the investment tables.
        rank_icon: For progressions that have it, this is the rank icon we use in the Companion, displayed above the progressions' rank value.
        redacted: If this is true, then there is an entity with this identifier/type combination, but BNet is not yet allowed to show it. Sorry!
        repeat_last_step: If this is True, then the progression doesn't have a maximum level.
        reward_items: _No description given by bungie._
        scope: The "Scope" of the progression indicates the source of the progression's live data. See the DestinyProgressionScope enum for more info: but essentially, a Progression can either be backed by a stored value, or it can be a calculated derivative of other values.
        source: If there's a description of how to earn this progression in the local config, this will be that localized description.
        steps: Progressions are divided into Steps, which roughly equate to "Levels" in the traditional sense of a Progression. Notably, the last step can be repeated indefinitely if repeatLastStep is true, meaning that the calculation for your level is not as simple as comparing your current progress to the max progress of the steps.  These and more calculations are done for you if you grab live character progression data, such as in the DestinyCharacterProgressionComponent.
        visible: If true, the Progression is something worth showing to users. If false, BNet isn't going to show it. But that doesn't mean you can't. We're all friends here.

    So much of what you see in Destiny is actually an Item used in a new and creative way. This is the definition for Items in Destiny, which started off as just entities that could exist in your Inventory but ended up being the backing data for so much more: quests, reward previews, slots, and subclasses. In practice, you will want to associate this data with "live" item data from a Bungie.Net Platform call: these definitions describe the item in generic, non-instanced terms: but an actual instance of an item can vary widely from these generic definitions.

    Tip: Manifest Information
        This model has some attributes which can be filled with additional information found in the manifest (`manifest_...`).
        Without additional work, these attributes will be `None`, since they require additional requests and database lookups.

        To fill the manifest dependent attributes, either:

        - Run `await ThisClass.fetch_manifest_information()`, see [here](/API Reference/Models/base)
        - Set `Client.always_return_manifest_information` to `True`, see [here](/API Reference/client)

    Attributes:
        action: If the item can be "used", this block will be non-null, and will have data related to the action performed when using the item. (Guess what? 99% of the time, this action is "dismantle". Shocker)
        allow_actions: BNet may forbid the execution of actions on this item via the API. If that is occurring, allowActions will be set to false.
        animations: If any animations were extracted from game content for this item, these will be the definitions of those animations.
        background_color: Sometimes, an item will have a background color. Most notably this occurs with Emblems, who use the Background Color for small character nameplates such as the "friends" view you see in-game. There are almost certainly other items that have background color as well, though I have not bothered to investigate what items have it nor what purposes they serve: use it as you will.
        breaker_type: Some weapons and plugs can have a "Breaker Type": a special ability that works sort of like damage type vulnerabilities. This is (almost?) always set on items by plugs.
        breaker_type_hash: Since we also have a breaker type definition, this is the hash for that breaker type for your convenience. Whether you use the enum or hash and look up the definition depends on what's cleanest for your code.
        class_type: We run a similarly weak-sauce algorithm to try and determine whether an item is restricted to a specific class. If we find it to be restricted in such a way, we set this classType property to match the class' enumeration value so that users can easily identify class restricted items. If you see a mis-classed item, please inform the developers in the Bungie API forum.
        collectible_hash: If this item has a collectible related to it, this is the hash identifier of that collectible entry.
        crafting: Recipe items will have relevant crafting information available here.
        damage_type_hashes: Theoretically, an item can have many possible damage types. In *practice*, this is not true, but just in case weapons start being made that have multiple (for instance, an item where a socket has reusable plugs for every possible damage type that you can choose from freely), this field will return all of the possible damage types that are available to the weapon by default.
        damage_types: This is the list of all damage types that we know ahead of time the item can take on. Unfortunately, this does not preclude the possibility of something funky happening to give the item a damage type that cannot be predicted beforehand: for example, if some designer decides to create arbitrary non-reusable plugs that cause damage type to change. This damage type prediction will only use the following to determine potential damage types: - Intrinsic perks - Talent Node perks - Known, reusable plugs for sockets
        default_damage_type: If the item has a damage type that could be considered to be default, it will be populated here. For various upsetting reasons, it's surprisingly cumbersome to figure this out. I hope you're happy.
        default_damage_type_hash: Similar to defaultDamageType, but represented as the hash identifier for a DestinyDamageTypeDefinition. I will likely regret leaving in the enumeration versions of these properties, but for now they're very convenient.
        display_properties: _No description given by bungie._
        display_source: In theory, it is a localized string telling you about how you can find the item. I really wish this was more consistent. Many times, it has nothing. Sometimes, it's instead a more narrative-forward description of the item. Which is cool, and I wish all properties had that data, but it should really be its own property.
        does_postmaster_pull_have_side_effects: The boolean will indicate to us (and you!) whether something *could* happen when you transfer this item from the Postmaster that might be considered a "destructive" action. It is not feasible currently to tell you (or ourelves!) in a consistent way whether this *will* actually cause a destructive action, so we are playing it safe: if it has the potential to do so, we will not allow it to be transferred from the Postmaster by default. You will need to check for this flag before transferring an item from the Postmaster, or else you'll end up receiving an error.
        emblem_objective_hash: If the item is an emblem that has a special Objective attached to it - for instance, if the emblem tracks PVP Kills, or what-have-you. This is a bit different from, for example, the Vanguard Kill Tracker mod, which pipes data into the "art channel". When I get some time, I would like to standardize these so you can get at the values they expose without having to care about what they're being used for and how they are wired up, but for now here's the raw data.
        equippable: If true, then you will be allowed to equip the item if you pass its other requirements. This being false means that you cannot equip the item under any circumstances.
        equipping_block: If this item can be equipped, this block will be non-null and will be populated with the conditions under which it can be equipped.
        flavor_text: _No description given by bungie._
        gearset: If this item has related items in a "Gear Set", this will be non-null and the relationships defined herein.
        hash: The unique identifier for this entity. Guaranteed to be unique for the type of entity, but not globally. When entities refer to each other in Destiny content, it is this hash that they are referring to.
        icon_watermark: If available, this is the original 'active' release watermark overlay for the icon. If the item has different versions, this can be overridden by the 'display version watermark icon' from the 'quality' block. Alternatively, if there is no watermark for the version, and the item version has a power cap below the current season power cap, this can be overridden by the iconWatermarkShelved property.
        icon_watermark_shelved: If available, this is the 'shelved' release watermark overlay for the icon. If the item version has a power cap below the current season power cap, it can be treated as 'shelved', and should be shown with this 'shelved' watermark overlay.
        index: The index of the entity as it was found in the investment tables.
        inventory: If this item can exist in an inventory, this block will be non-null. In practice, every item that currently exists has one of these blocks. But note that it is not necessarily guaranteed.
        investment_stats: If the item has stats, this block will be defined. It has the "raw" investment stats for the item. These investment stats don't take into account the ways that the items can spawn, nor do they take into account any Stat Group transformations. I have retained them for debugging purposes, but I do not know how useful people will find them.
        is_wrapper: If true, this is a dummy vendor-wrapped item template. Items purchased from Eververse will be "wrapped" by one of these items so that we can safely provide refund capabilities before the item is "unwrapped".
        item_category_hashes: BNet attempts to make a more formal definition of item "Categories", as defined by DestinyItemCategoryDefinition. This is a list of all Categories that we were able to algorithmically determine that this item is a member of. (for instance, that it's a "Weapon", that it's an "Auto Rifle", etc...) The algorithm for these is, unfortunately, volatile. If you believe you see a miscategorized item, please let us know on the Bungie API forums.
        item_sub_type: A value indicating the "sub-type" of the item. For instance, where an item might have an itemType value "Weapon", this will be something more specific like "Auto Rifle". itemCategoryHashes are the preferred way of identifying types, we have retained this enum for its convenience.
        item_type: A value indicating the "base" the of the item. This enum is a useful but dramatic oversimplification of what it means for an item to have a "Type". Still, it's handy in many situations. itemCategoryHashes are the preferred way of identifying types, we have retained this enum for its convenience.
        item_type_and_tier_display_name: It became a common enough pattern in our UI to show Item Type and Tier combined into a single localized string that I'm just going to go ahead and start pre-creating these for items.
        item_type_display_name: The localized title/name of the item's type. This can be whatever the designers want, and has no guarantee of consistency between items.
        links: If we added any help or informational URLs about this item, these will be those links.
        lore_hash: If the item has any related Lore (DestinyLoreDefinition), this will be the hash identifier you can use to look up the lore definition.
        metrics: If this item has available metrics to be shown, this block will be non-null have the appropriate hashes defined.
        non_transferrable: The intrinsic transferability of an item. I hate that this boolean is negative - but there's a reason. Just because an item is intrinsically transferrable doesn't mean that it can be transferred, and we don't want to imply that this is the only source of that transferability.
        objectives: If this item has Objectives (extra tasks that can be accomplished related to the item... most frequently when the item is a Quest Step and the Objectives need to be completed to move on to the next Quest Step), this block will be non-null and the objectives defined herein.
        perks: If the item has any *intrinsic* Perks (Perks that it will provide regardless of Sockets, Talent Grid, and other transitory state), they will be defined here.
        plug: If this item *is* a Plug, this will be non-null and the info defined herein. See DestinyItemPlugDefinition for more information.
        preview: If this item can be Used or Acquired to gain other items (for instance, how Eververse Boxes can be consumed to get items from the box), this block will be non-null and will give summary information for the items that can be acquired.
        quality: If this item can have a level or stats, this block will be non-null and will be populated with default quality (item level, "quality", and infusion) data. See the block for more details, there's often less upfront information in D2 so you'll want to be aware of how you use quality and item level on the definition level now.
        redacted: If this is true, then there is an entity with this identifier/type combination, but BNet is not yet allowed to show it. Sorry!
        sack: If this item is a "reward sack" that can be opened to provide other items, this will be non-null and the properties of the sack contained herein.
        screenshot: If we were able to acquire an in-game screenshot for the item, the path to that screenshot will be returned here. Note that not all items have screenshots: particularly not any non-equippable items.
        season_hash: If this item is related directly to a Season of Destiny, this is the hash identifier for that season.
        secondary_icon: A secondary icon associated with the item. Currently this is used in very context specific applications, such as Emblem Nameplates.
        secondary_overlay: Pulled from the secondary icon, this is the "secondary background" of the secondary icon. Confusing? Sure, that's why I call it "overlay" here: because as far as it's been used thus far, it has been for an optional overlay image. We'll see if that holds up, but at least for now it explains what this image is a bit better.
        secondary_special: Pulled from the Secondary Icon, this is the "special" background for the item. For Emblems, this is the background image used on the Details view: but it need not be limited to that for other types of items.
        set_data: If this item is a quest, this block will be non-null. In practice, I wish I had called this the Quest block, but at the time it wasn't clear to me whether it would end up being used for purposes other than quests. It will contain data about the steps in the quest, and mechanics we can use for displaying and tracking the quest.
        sockets: If this item has any Sockets, this will be non-null and the individual sockets on the item will be defined herein.
        source_data: If this item has a known source, this block will be non-null and populated with source information. Unfortunately, at this time we are not generating sources: that is some aggressively manual work which we didn't have time for, and I'm hoping to get back to at some point in the future.
        special_item_type: In Destiny 1, we identified some items as having particular categories that we'd like to know about for various internal logic purposes. These are defined in SpecialItemType, and while these days the itemCategoryHashes are the preferred way of identifying types, we have retained this enum for its convenience.
        stats: If this item can have stats (such as a weapon, armor, or vehicle), this block will be non-null and populated with the stats found on the item.
        summary: Summary data about the item.
        summary_item_hash: There are times when the game will show you a "summary/vague" version of an item - such as a description of its type represented as a DestinyInventoryItemDefinition - rather than display the item itself. This happens sometimes when summarizing possible rewards in a tooltip. This is the item displayed instead, if it exists.
        talent_grid: If the item has a Talent Grid, this will be non-null and the properties of the grid defined herein. Note that, while many items still have talent grids, the only ones with meaningful Nodes still on them will be Subclass/"Build" items.
        tooltip_notifications: Tooltips that only come up conditionally for the item. Check the live data DestinyItemComponent.tooltipNotificationIndexes property for which of these should be shown at runtime.
        tooltip_style: An identifier that the game UI uses to determine what type of tooltip to show for the item. These have no corresponding definitions that BNet can link to: so it'll be up to you to interpret and display your UI differently according to these styles (or ignore it).
        trait_hashes: These are the corresponding trait definition hashes for the entries in traitIds.
        trait_ids: Traits are metadata tags applied to this item. For example: armor slot, weapon type, foundry, faction, etc. These IDs come from the game and don't map to any content, but should still be useful.
        translation_block: If this item can be rendered, this block will be non-null and will be populated with rendering information.
        ui_item_display_style: A string identifier that the game's UI uses to determine how the item should be rendered in inventory screens and the like. This could really be anything - at the moment, we don't have the time to really breakdown and maintain all the possible strings this could be, partly because new ones could be added ad hoc. But if you want to use it to dictate your own UI, or look for items with a certain display style, go for it!
        value: The conceptual "Value" of an item, if any was defined. See the DestinyItemValueBlockDefinition for more details.

    An Inventory (be it Character or Profile level) is comprised of many Buckets. An example of a bucket is "Primary Weapons", where all of the primary weapons on a character are gathered together into a single visual element in the UI: a subset of the inventory that has a limited number of slots, and in this case also has an associated Equipment Slot for equipping an item in the bucket. Item definitions declare what their "default" bucket is (DestinyInventoryItemDefinition.inventory.bucketTypeHash), and Item instances will tell you which bucket they are currently residing in (DestinyItemComponent.bucketHash). You can use this information along with the DestinyInventoryBucketDefinition to show these items grouped by bucket. You cannot transfer an item to a bucket that is not its Default without going through a Vendor's "accepted items" (DestinyVendorDefinition.acceptedItems). This is how transfer functionality like the Vault is implemented, as a feature of a Vendor. See the vendor's acceptedItems property for more details.

If this is FALSE, the bucket will not allow new items to be placed in it until room is made by the user manually deleting items from it. You can see an example of this with the Postmaster's bucket.
        has_transfer_destination: If TRUE, there is at least one Vendor that can transfer items to/from this bucket. See the DestinyVendorDefinition's acceptedItems property for more information on how transferring works.
        hash: The unique identifier for this entity. Guaranteed to be unique for the type of entity, but not globally. When entities refer to each other in Destiny content, it is this hash that they are referring to.
        index: The index of the entity as it was found in the investment tables.
        item_count: The maximum # of item "slots" in a bucket. A slot is a given combination of item + quantity. For instance, a Weapon will always take up a single slot, and always have a quantity of 1. But a material could take up only a single slot with hundreds of quantity.
        location: Sometimes, inventory buckets represent conceptual "locations" in the game that might not be expected. This value indicates the conceptual location of the bucket, regardless of where it is actually contained on the character/account.  See ItemLocation for details.

    """
    This represents a stat that's applied to a character or an item (such as a weapon, piece of armor, or a vehicle). An example of a stat might be Attack Power on a weapon. Stats go through a complex set of transformations before they end up being shown to the user as a number or a progress bar, and those transformations are fundamentally intertwined with the concept of a "Stat Group" (DestinyStatGroupDefinition). Items have both Stats and a reference to a Stat Group, and it is the Stat Group that takes the raw stat information and gives it both rendering metadata (such as whether to show it as a number or a progress bar) and the final transformation data (interpolation tables to turn the raw investment stat into a display stat). Please see DestinyStatGroupDefinition for more information on that transformational process. Stats are segregated from Stat Groups because different items and types of items can refer to the same stat, but have different "scales" for the stat while still having the same underlying value. For example, both a Shotgun and an Auto Rifle may have a "raw" impact stat of 50, but the Auto Rifle's Stat Group will scale that 50 down so that, when it is displayed, it is a smaller value relative to the shotgun. (this is a totally made up example, don't assume shotguns have naturally higher impact than auto rifles because of this) A final caveat is that some stats, even after this "final" transformation, go through yet another set of transformations directly in the game as a result of dynamic, stateful scripts that get run. BNet has no access to these scripts, nor any way to know which scripts get executed. As a result, the stats for an item that you see in-game - particularly for stats that are often impacted by Perks, like Magazine Size - can change dramatically from what we return on Bungie.Net. This is a known issue with no fix coming down the pipeline. Take these stats with a grain of salt. Stats actually go through four transformations, for those interested: 1) "Sandbox" stat, the "most raw" form. These are pretty much useless without transformations applied, and thus are not currently returned in the API. If you really want these, we can provide them. Maybe someone could do something cool with it? 2) "Investment" stat (the stat's value after DestinyStatDefinition's interpolation tables and aggregation logic is applied to the "Sandbox" stat value) 3) "Display" stat (the stat's base UI-visible value after DestinyStatGroupDefinition's interpolation tables are applied to the Investment Stat value. For most stats, this is what is displayed.) 4) Underlying in-game stat (the stat's actual value according to the game, after the game runs dynamic scripts based on the game and character's state. This is the final transformation that BNet does not have access to. For most stats, this is not actually displayed to the user, with the exception of Magazine Size which is then piped back to the UI for display in-game, but not to BNet.)

If you don't want to do these calculations on your own, fear not: pulling live data from the BNet endpoints will return display stat values pre-computed and ready for you to use.

class DestinyVendorDefinition(ManifestModel):
    """
    These are the definitions for Vendors. In Destiny, a Vendor can be a lot of things - some things that you wouldn't expect, and some things that you don't even see directly in the game. Vendors are the Dolly Levi of the Destiny universe. - Traditional Vendors as you see in game: people who you come up to and who give you quests, rewards, or who you can buy things from. - Kiosks/Collections, which are really just Vendors that don't charge currency (or charge some pittance of a currency) and whose gating for purchases revolves more around your character's state. - Previews for rewards or the contents of sacks. These are implemented as Vendors, where you can't actually purchase from them but the items that they have for sale and the categories of sale items reflect the rewards or contents of the sack. This is so that the game could reuse the existing Vendor display UI for rewards and save a bunch of wheel reinvention. - Item Transfer capabilities, like the Vault and Postmaster. Vendors can have "acceptedItem" buckets that determine the source and destination buckets for transfers. When you interact with such a vendor, these buckets are what gets shown in the UI instead of any items that the Vendor would have for sale. Yep, the Vault is a vendor. It is pretty much guaranteed that they'll be used for even more features in the future. They have come to be seen more as generic categorized containers for items than "vendors" in a traditional sense, for better or worse. Where possible and time allows, we'll attempt to split those out into their own more digestible derived "Definitions": but often time does not allow that, as you can see from the above ways that vendors are used which we never split off from Vendor Definitions externally. Since Vendors are so many things to so many parts of the game, the definition is understandably complex. You will want to combine this data with live Vendor information from the API when it is available.

    Tip: Manifest Information
        This model has some attributes which can be filled with additional information found in the manifest (`manifest_...`).
        Without additional work, these attributes will be `None`, since they require additional requests and database lookups.

        To fill the manifest dependent attributes, either:

        - Run `await ThisClass.fetch_manifest_information()`, see [here](/API Reference/Models/base)
        - Set `Client.always_return_manifest_information` to `True`, see [here](/API Reference/client)

    Attributes:
        accepted_items: If the Vendor is actually a vehicle for the transferring of items (like the Vault and Postmaster vendors), this defines the list of source->destination buckets for transferring.
        actions: Describes "actions" that can be performed on a vendor. Currently, none of these exist. But theoretically a Vendor could let you interact with it by performing actions. We'll see what these end up looking like if they ever get used.
        buy_string: If the vendor has a custom localized string describing the "buy" action, that is returned here.
        categories: These are the headers for sections of items that the vendor is selling. When you see items organized by category in the header, it is these categories that it is showing. Well, technically not *exactly* these. On BNet, it doesn't make sense to have categories be "paged" as we do in Destiny, so we run some heuristics to attempt to aggregate pages of categories together.  These are the categories post-concatenation, if the vendor had concatenation applied. If you want the pre-aggregated category data, use originalCategories.
        consolidate_categories: If TRUE, consolidate categories that only differ by trivial properties (such as having minor differences in name)
        display_categories: Display Categories are different from "categories" in that these are specifically for visual grouping and display of categories in Vendor UI.  The "categories" structure is for validation of the contained items, and can be categorized entirely separately from "Display Categories", there need be and often will be no meaningful relationship between the two.
        display_item_hash: If the vendor has an item that should be displayed as the "featured" item, this is the hash identifier for that DestinyVendorItemDefinition. Apparently this is usually a related currency, like a reputation token. But it need not be restricted to that.
        display_properties: _No description given by bungie._
        enabled: If a vendor is not enabled, we won't even save the vendor's definition, and we won't return any items or info about them. It's as if they don't exist.
        faction_hash: If the Vendor has a faction, this hash will be valid and point to a DestinyFactionDefinition. The game UI and BNet often mine the faction definition for additional elements and details to place on the screen, such as the faction's Progression status (aka "Reputation").
        failure_strings: If an item can't be purchased from the vendor, there may be many "custom"/game state specific reasons why not. This is a list of localized strings with messages for those custom failures. The live BNet data will return a failureIndexes property for items that can't be purchased: using those values to index into this array, you can show the user the appropriate failure message for the item that can't be bought.
        groups: A vendor can be a part of 0 or 1 "groups" at a time: a group being a collection of Vendors related by either location or function/purpose. It's used for our our Companion Vendor UI. Only one of these can be active for a Vendor at a time.
        hash: The unique identifier for this entity. Guaranteed to be unique for the type of entity, but not globally. When entities refer to each other in Destiny content, it is this hash that they are referring to.
        ignore_sale_item_hashes: Some items don't make sense to return in the API, for example because they represent an action to be performed rather than an item being sold. I'd rather we not do this, but at least in the short term this is a workable workaround.
        index: The index of the entity as it was found in the investment tables.
        inhibit_buying: If this is true, you aren't allowed to buy whatever the vendor is selling.
        inhibit_selling: If this is true, you're not allowed to sell whatever the vendor is buying.
        interactions: In addition to selling items, vendors can have "interactions": UI where you "talk" with the vendor and they offer you a reward, some item, or merely acknowledge via dialog that you did something cool.
        inventory_flyouts: If the vendor shows you items from your own inventory - such as the Vault vendor does - this data describes the UI around showing those inventory buckets and which ones get shown.
        item_list: If the vendor sells items (or merely has a list of items to show like the "Sack" vendors do), this is the list of those items that the vendor can sell. From this list, only a subset will be available from the vendor at any given time, selected randomly and reset on the vendor's refresh interval. Note that a vendor can sell the same item multiple ways: for instance, nothing stops a vendor from selling you some specific weapon but using two different currencies, or the same weapon at multiple "item levels".
        locations: A vendor can be at different places in the world depending on the game/character/account state. This is the list of possible locations for the vendor, along with conditions we use to determine which one is currently active.
        original_categories: See the categories property for a description of categories and why originalCategories exists.
        redacted: If this is true, then there is an entity with this identifier/type combination, but BNet is not yet allowed to show it. Sorry!
        reset_interval_minutes: A number used for calculating the frequency of a vendor's inventory resetting/refreshing. Don't worry about calculating this - we do it on the server side and send you the next refresh date with the live data.
        reset_offset_minutes: Again, used for reset/refreshing of inventory. Don't worry too much about it. Unless you want to.
        return_with_vendor_request: As many of you know, Vendor data has historically been pretty brutal on the BNet servers. In an effort to reduce this workload, only Vendors with this flag set will be returned on Vendor requests. This allows us to filter out Vendors that don't dynamic data that's particularly useful: things like "Preview/Sack" vendors, for example, that you can usually suss out the details for using just the definitions themselves.
        sell_string: Ditto for selling. Not that you can sell items to a vendor anymore. Will it come back? Who knows. The string's still there.
        services: BNet doesn't use this data yet, but it appears to be an optional list of flavor text about services that the Vendor can provide.
        unlock_ranges: If we were able to predict the dates when this Vendor will be visible/available, this will be the list of those date ranges. Sadly, we're not able to predict this very frequently, so this will often be useless data.
        vendor_banner: If the vendor has a custom banner image, that can be found here.
        vendor_identifier: The internal identifier for the Vendor. A holdover from the old days of Vendors, but we don't have time to refactor it away.
        vendor_portrait: A portrait of the Vendor's smiling mug. Or frothing tentacles.
        vendor_progression_type: The type of reward progression that this vendor has. Default - The original rank progression from token redemption. Ritual - Progression from ranks in ritual content. For example: Crucible (Shaxx), Gambit (Drifter), and Battlegrounds (War Table).
        vendor_subcategory_identifier: The identifier of the VendorCategoryDefinition for this vendor's subcategory.
        visible: If a vendor is not visible, we still have and will give vendor definition info, but we won't use them for things like Advisors or UI.

    Attributes:
        action: The action to be performed when purchasing the item, if it's not just "buy".
        category_index: The index into the DestinyVendorDefinition.categories array, so you can find the category associated with this item.
        creation_levels: The Default level at which the item will spawn. Almost always driven by an adjusto these days. Ideally should be singular. It's a long story how this ended up as a list, but there is always either going to be 0:1 of these entities.
        currencies: This is a pre-compiled aggregation of item value and priceOverrideList, so that we have one place to check for what the purchaser must pay for the item. Use this instead of trying to piece together the price separately. The somewhat crappy part about this is that, now that item quantity overrides have dynamic modifiers, this will not necessarily be statically true. If you were using this instead of live data, switch to using live data.
        display_category: The string identifier for the category selling this item.
        display_category_index: This is an index specifically into the display category, as opposed to the server-side Categories (which do not need to match or pair with each other in any way: server side categories are really just structures for common validation. Display Category will let us more easily categorize items visually)
        exclusivity: If this item can only be purchased by a given platform, this indicates the platform to which it is restricted.
        expiration_tooltip: If this item can expire, this is the tooltip message to show with its expiration info.
        failure_indexes: An list of indexes into the DestinyVendorDefinition.failureStrings array, indicating the possible failure strings that can be relevant for this item.
        inventory_bucket_hash: The inventory bucket into which this item will be placed upon purchase.
        is_crm: If this sale can only be performed as the result of receiving a CRM offer, this is true.
        is_offer: If this sale can only be performed as the result of an offer check, this is true.
        item_hash: The hash identifier of the item being sold (DestinyInventoryItemDefinition). Note that a vendor can sell the same item in multiple ways, so don't assume that itemHash is a unique identifier for this entity.
        maximum_level: The maximum character level at which this item is available for sale.
        minimum_level: The minimum character level at which this item is available for sale.
        original_category_index: Same as above, but for the original category indexes.
        purchasable_scope: Similar to visibilityScope, it represents the most restrictive scope that determines whether the item can be purchased. It will at least be as restrictive as visibilityScope, but could be more restrictive if the item has additional purchase requirements beyond whether it is merely visible or not. See DestinyGatingScope's documentation for more information.
        quantity: The amount you will recieve of the item described in itemHash if you make the purchase.
        redirect_to_sale_indexes: If this is populated, the purchase of this item should redirect to purchasing these other items instead.
        refund_policy: If this item can be refunded, this is the policy for what will be refundd, how, and in what time period.
        refund_time_limit: The amount of time before refundability of the newly purchased item will expire.
        socket_overrides: _No description given by bungie._
        sort_value: *if* the category this item is in supports non-default sorting, this value should represent the sorting value to use, pre-processed and ready to go.
        unpurchasable: If true, this item is some sort of dummy sale item that cannot actually be purchased. It may be a display only item, or some fluff left by a content designer for testing purposes, or something that got disabled because it was a terrible idea. You get the picture. We won't know *why* it can't be purchased, only that it can't be. Sorry. This is also only whether it's unpurchasable as a static property according to game content. There are other reasons why an item may or may not be purchasable at runtime, so even if this isn't set to True you should trust the runtime value for this sale item over the static definition if this is unset.
        vendor_item_index: The index into the DestinyVendorDefinition.saleList. This is what we use to refer to items being sold throughout live and definition data.
        visibility_scope: The most restrictive scope that determines whether the item is available in the Vendor's inventory. See DestinyGatingScope's documentation for more information. This can be determined by Unlock gating, or by whether or not the item has purchase level requirements (minimumLevel and maximumLevel properties).

    The static data about Activities in Destiny 2. Note that an Activity must be combined with an ActivityMode to know - from a Gameplay perspective - what the user is "Playing". In most PvE activities, this is fairly straightforward. A Story Activity can only be played in the Story Activity Mode. However, in PvP activities, the Activity alone only tells you the map being played, or the Playlist that the user chose to enter. You'll need to know the Activity Mode they're playing to know that they're playing Mode X on Map Y. Activity Definitions tell a great deal of information about what *could* be relevant to a user: what rewards they can earn, what challenges could be performed, what modifiers could be applied. To figure out which of these properties is actually live, you'll need to combine the definition with "Live" data from one of the Destiny endpoints. Activities also have Activity Types, but unfortunately in Destiny 2 these are even less reliable of a source of information than they were in Destiny 1. I will be looking into ways to provide more reliable sources for type information as time goes on, but for now we're going to have to deal with the limitations. See DestinyActivityTypeDefinition for more information.

        - Set `Client.always_return_manifest_information` to `True`, see [here](/API Reference/client)

    Attributes:
        activity_graph_list: Unfortunately, in practice this is almost never populated. In theory, this is supposed to tell which Activity Graph to show if you bring up the director while in this activity.
        activity_light_level: The recommended light level for this activity.
        activity_location_mappings: A list of location mappings that are affected by this activity. Pulled out of DestinyLocationDefinitions for our/your lookup convenience.
        activity_mode_hashes: The hash identifiers for Activity Modes relevant to this activity.  Note that if this is a playlist, the specific playlist entry chosen will determine the actual activity modes that end up being relevant.
        activity_mode_types: The activity modes - if any - in enum form. Because we can't seem to escape the enums.
        activity_type_hash: The hash identifier for the Activity Type of this Activity. You may use it to look up the DestinyActivityTypeDefinition for human readable info, but be forewarned: Playlists and many PVP Map Activities will map to generic Activity Types. You'll have to use your knowledge of the Activity Mode being played to get more specific information about what the user is playing.
        challenges: An activity can have many Challenges, of which any subset of them may be active for play at any given period of time. This gives the information about the challenges and data that we use to understand when they're active and what rewards they provide. Sadly, at the moment there's no central definition for challenges: much like "Skulls" were in Destiny 1, these are defined on individual activities and there can be many duplicates/near duplicates across the Destiny 2 ecosystem. I have it in mind to centralize these in a future revision of the API, but we are out of time.
        destination_hash: The hash identifier for the Destination on which this Activity is played. Use it to look up the DestinyDestinationDefinition for human readable info about the destination. A Destination can be thought of as a more specific location than a "Place". For instance, if the "Place" is Earth, the "Destination" would be a specific city or region on Earth.
        direct_activity_mode_hash: If this activity had an activity mode directly defined on it, this will be the hash of that mode.
        direct_activity_mode_type: If the activity had an activity mode directly defined on it, this will be the enum value of that mode.
        display_properties: The title, subtitle, and icon for the activity. We do a little post-processing on this to try and account for Activities where the designers have left this data too minimal to determine what activity is actually being played.
        guided_game: This block of data, if it exists, provides information about the guided game experience and restrictions for this activity. If it doesn't exist, the game is not able to be played as a guided game.
        hash: The unique identifier for this entity. Guaranteed to be unique for the type of entity, but not globally. When entities refer to each other in Destiny content, it is this hash that they are referring to.
        index: The index of the entity as it was found in the investment tables.
        insertion_points: The list of phases or points of entry into an activity, along with information we can use to determine their gating and availability.
        is_playlist: If True, this Activity is actually a Playlist that refers to multiple possible specific Activities and Activity Modes. For instance, a Crucible Playlist may have references to multiple Activities (Maps) with multiple Activity Modes (specific PvP gameplay modes). If this is true, refer to the playlistItems property for the specific entries in the playlist.
        is_pv_p: If true, this activity is a PVP activity or playlist.
        loadouts: The set of all possible loadout requirements that could be active for this activity. Only one will be active at any given time, and you can discover which one through activity-associated data such as Milestones that have activity info on them.
        matchmaking: This block of data provides information about the Activity's matchmaking attributes: how many people can join and such.
        modifiers: Activities can have Modifiers, as defined in DestinyActivityModifierDefinition. These are references to the modifiers that *can* be applied to that activity, along with data that we use to determine if that modifier is actually active at any given point in time.
        optional_unlock_strings: If there are status strings related to the activity and based on internal state of the game, account, or character, then this will be the definition of those strings and the states needed in order for the strings to be shown.
        original_display_properties: The unadulterated form of the display properties, as they ought to be shown in the Director (if the activity appears in the director).
        pgcr_image: When Activities are completed, we generate a "Post-Game Carnage Report", or PGCR, with details about what happened in that activity (how many kills someone got, which team won, etc...) We use this image as the background when displaying PGCR information, and often use it when we refer to the Activity in general.
        place_hash: The hash identifier for the "Place" on which this Activity is played. Use it to look up the DestinyPlaceDefinition for human readable info about the Place. A Place is the largest-scoped concept for location information. For instance, if the "Place" is Earth, the "Destination" would be a specific city or region on Earth.
        playlist_items: Represents all of the possible activities that could be played in the Playlist, along with information that we can use to determine if they are active at the present time.
        redacted: If this is true, then there is an entity with this identifier/type combination, but BNet is not yet allowed to show it. Sorry!
        release_icon: If the activity has an icon associated with a specific release (such as a DLC), this is the path to that release's icon.
        release_time: If the activity will not be visible until a specific and known time, this will be the seconds since the Epoch when it will become visible.
        rewards: The expected possible rewards for the activity. These rewards may or may not be accessible for an individual player based on their character state, the account state, and even the game's state overall. But it is a useful reference for possible rewards you can earn in the activity. These match up to rewards displayed when you hover over the Activity in the in-game Director, and often refer to Placeholder or "Dummy" items: items that tell you what you can earn in vague terms rather than what you'll specifically be earning (partly because the game doesn't even know what you'll earn specifically until you roll for it at the end)
        selection_screen_display_properties: The title, subtitle, and icon for the activity as determined by Selection Screen data, if there is any for this activity. There won't be data in this field if the activity is never shown in a selection/options screen.
        tier: The difficulty tier of the activity.

        manifest_destination_hash: Manifest information for `destination_hash`

        default_visible: If true, then this socket is visible in the item's "default" state. If you have an instance, you should always check the runtime state, as that can override this visibility setting: but if you're looking at the item on a conceptual level, this property can be useful for hiding data such as legacy sockets - which remain defined on items for infrastructure purposes, but can be confusing for users to see.
        hide_perks_in_item_tooltip: If this is true, the perks provided by this socket shouldn't be shown in the item's tooltip. This might be useful if it's providing a hidden bonus, or if the bonus is less important than other benefits on the item.
        plug_sources: Indicates where you should go to get plugs for this socket. This will affect how you populate your UI, as well as what plugs are valid for this socket. It's an alternative to having to check for the existence of certain properties (reusablePlugItems for example) to infer where plugs should come from.
        prevent_initialization_on_vendor_purchase: If this is true, then the socket will not be initialized with a plug if the item is purchased from a Vendor. Remember that Vendors are much more than conceptual vendors: they include "Collection Kiosks" and other entities. See DestinyVendorDefinition for more information.
        randomized_plug_set_hash: This field replaces "randomizedPlugItems" as of Shadowkeep launch. If a socket has randomized plugs, this is a pointer to the set of plugs that could be used, as defined in DestinyPlugSetDefinition.  If null, the item has no randomized plugs.
        reusable_plug_items: This is a list of pre-determined plugs that can *always* be plugged into this socket, without the character having the plug in their inventory. If this list is populated, you will not be allowed to plug an arbitrary item in the socket: you will only be able to choose from one of these reusable plugs.
        reusable_plug_set_hash: If this socket's plugs come from a reusable DestinyPlugSetDefinition, this is the identifier for that set. We added this concept to reduce some major duplication that's going to come from sockets as replacements for what was once implemented as large sets of items and kiosks (like Emotes).  As of Shadowkeep, these will come up much more frequently and be driven by game content rather than custom curation.
        single_initial_item_hash: If a valid hash, this is the hash identifier for the DestinyInventoryItemDefinition representing the Plug that will be initially inserted into the item on item creation. Otherwise, this Socket will either start without a plug inserted, or will have one randomly inserted.

    The time has unfortunately come to talk about Talent Grids. Talent Grids are the most complex and unintuitive part of the Destiny Definition data. Grab a cup of coffee before we begin, I can wait. Talent Grids were the primary way that items could be customized in Destiny 1. In Destiny 2, for now, talent grids have become exclusively used by Subclass/Build items: but the system is still in place for it to be used by items should the direction change back toward talent grids. Talent Grids have Nodes: the visual circles on the talent grid detail screen that have icons and can be activated if you meet certain requirements and pay costs. The actual visual data and effects, however, are driven by the "Steps" on Talent Nodes. Any given node will have 1:M of these steps, and the specific step that will be considered the "current" step (and thus the dictator of all benefits, visual state, and activation requirements on the Node) will almost always not be determined until an instance of the item is created. This is how, in Destiny 1, items were able to have such a wide variety of what users saw as "Perks": they were actually Talent Grids with nodes that had a wide variety of Steps, randomly chosen at the time of item creation. Now that Talent Grids are used exclusively by subclasses and builds, all of the properties within still apply: but there are additional visual elements on the Subclass/Build screens that are superimposed on top of the talent nodes. Unfortunately, BNet doesn't have this data: if you want to build a subclass screen, you will have to provide your own "decorative" assets, such as the visual connectors between nodes and the fancy colored-fire-bathed character standing behind the nodes. DestinyInventoryItem.talentGrid.talentGridHash defines an item's linked Talent Grid, which brings you to this definition that contains enough satic data about talent grids to make your head spin. These *must* be combined with instanced data - found when live data returns DestinyItemTalentGridComponent - in order to derive meaning. The instanced data will reference nodes and steps within these definitions, which you will then have to look up in the definition and combine with the instanced data to give the user the visual representation of their item's talent grid.

        - Set `Client.always_return_manifest_information` to `True`, see [here](/API Reference/client)

    Attributes:
        exclusive_sets: Talent Nodes can exist in "exclusive sets": these are sets of nodes in which only a single node in the set can be activated at any given time. Activating a node in this set will automatically deactivate the other nodes in the set (referred to as a "Swap"). If a node in the exclusive set has already been activated, the game will not charge you materials to activate another node in the set, even if you have never activated it before, because you already paid the cost to activate one node in the set. Not to be confused with Exclusive Groups. (how the heck do we NOT get confused by that? Jeez) See the groups property for information about that only-tangentially-related concept.
        grid_level_per_column: The meaning of this has been lost in the sands of time: it still exists as a property, but appears to be unused in the modern UI of talent grids. It used to imply that each visual "column" of talent nodes required identical progression levels in order to be activated. Returning this value in case it is still useful to someone? Perhaps it's just a bit of interesting history.
        groups: Talent Nodes can have "Exclusive Groups". These are not to be confused with Exclusive Sets (see exclusiveSets property). Look at the definition of DestinyTalentExclusiveGroup for more information and how they work. These groups are keyed by the "groupHash" from DestinyTalentExclusiveGroup.
        hash: The unique identifier for this entity. Guaranteed to be unique for the type of entity, but not globally. When entities refer to each other in Destiny content, it is this hash that they are referring to.
        independent_node_indexes: This is a quick reference to the indexes of nodes that are not part of exclusive sets. Handy for knowing which talent nodes can only be activated directly, rather than via swapping.
        index: The index of the entity as it was found in the investment tables.
        max_grid_level: The maximum possible level of the Talent Grid: at this level, any nodes are allowed to be activated.
        node_categories: BNet wants to show talent nodes grouped by similar purpose with localized titles. This is the ordered list of those categories: if you want to show nodes by category, you can iterate over this list, render the displayProperties for the category as the title, and then iterate over the talent nodes referenced by the category to show the related nodes.

These are purely for visual grouping of nodes rather than functional grouping.
        nodes: The list of Talent Nodes on the Grid (recall that Nodes themselves are really just locations in the UI to show whatever their current Step is.

class DestinyTalentNodeDefinition(BaseModel):
    """
    Talent Grids on items have Nodes. These nodes have positions in the talent grid's UI, and contain "Steps" (DestinyTalentNodeStepDefinition), one of whom will be the "Current" step. The Current Step determines the visual properties of the node, as well as what the node grants when it is activated. See DestinyTalentGridDefinition for a more complete overview of how Talent Grids work, and how they are used in Destiny 2 (and how they were used in Destiny 1).

    Tip: Manifest Information
        This model has some attributes which can be filled with additional information found in the manifest (`manifest_...`).
        Without additional work, these attributes will be `None`, since they require additional requests and database lookups.

        To fill the manifest dependent attributes, either:

        - Run `await ThisClass.fetch_manifest_information()`, see [here](/API Reference/Models/base)
        - Set `Client.always_return_manifest_information` to `True`, see [here](/API Reference/client)

    Attributes:
        auto_unlocks: If true, this node will automatically unlock when the Talent Grid's level reaches the required level of the current step of this node.
        binary_pair_node_index: At one point, Talent Nodes supported the idea of "Binary Pairs": nodes that overlapped each other visually, and where activating one deactivated the other. They ended up not being used, mostly because Exclusive Sets are *almost* a superset of this concept, but the potential for it to be used still exists in theory. If this is ever used, this will be the index into the DestinyTalentGridDefinition.nodes property for the node that is the binary pair match to this node. Activating one deactivates the other.
        column: The visual "column" where the node should be shown in the UI. If negative, the node is hidden.
        exclusive_with_node_hashes: The nodeHash values for nodes that are in an Exclusive Set with this node. See DestinyTalentGridDefinition.exclusiveSets for more info about exclusive sets. Again, note that these are nodeHashes and *not* nodeIndexes.
        group_hash: As of Destiny 2, nodes can exist as part of "Exclusive Groups". These differ from exclusive sets in that, within the group, many nodes can be activated. But the act of activating any node in the group will cause "opposing" nodes (nodes in groups that are not allowed to be activated at the same time as this group) to deactivate. See DestinyTalentExclusiveGroup for more information on the details. This is an identifier for this node's group, if it is part of one.
        ignore_for_completion: Comes from the talent grid node style: if true, then this node should be ignored for determining whether the grid is complete.
        is_random: If this is true, the node's step is determined randomly rather than the first step being chosen.
        is_random_repurchasable: If this is true, the node can be "re-rolled" to acquire a different random current step. This is not used, but still exists for a theoretical future of talent grids.
        last_step_repeats: At one point, Nodes were going to be able to be activated multiple times, changing the current step and potentially piling on multiple effects from the previously activated steps. This property would indicate if the last step could be activated multiple times.  This is not currently used, but it isn't out of the question that this could end up being used again in a theoretical future.
        layout_identifier: A string identifier for a custom visual layout to apply to this talent node. Unfortunately, we do not have any data for rendering these custom layouts. It will be up to you to interpret these strings and change your UI if you want to have custom UI matching these layouts.
        lore_hash: Talent nodes can be associated with a piece of Lore, generally rendered in a tooltip. This is the hash identifier of the lore element to show, if there is one to be show.
        node_hash: The hash identifier for the node, which unfortunately is also content version dependent but can be (and ideally, should be) used instead of the nodeIndex to uniquely identify the node. The two exist side-by-side for backcompat reasons due to the Great Talent Node Restructuring of Destiny 1, and I ran out of time to remove one of them and standardize on the other. Sorry!
        node_index: The index into the DestinyTalentGridDefinition's "nodes" property where this node is located. Used to uniquely identify the node within the Talent Grid. Note that this is content version dependent: make sure you have the latest version of content before trying to use these properties.
        node_style_identifier: Comes from the talent grid node style: this identifier should be used to determine how to render the node in the UI.
        prerequisite_node_indexes: Indexes into the DestinyTalentGridDefinition.nodes property for any nodes that must be activated before this one is allowed to be activated. I would have liked to change this to hashes for Destiny 2, but we have run out of time.
        random_activation_requirement: At one point, you were going to be able to repurchase talent nodes that had random steps, to "re-roll" the current step of the node (and thus change the properties of your item). This was to be the activation requirement for performing that re-roll. The system still exists to do this, as far as I know, so it may yet come back around!
        random_start_progression_bar_at_progression: If the node's step is randomly selected, this is the amount of the Talent Grid's progression experience at which the progression bar for the node should be shown.
        row: The visual "row" where the node should be shown in the UI. If negative, then the node is hidden.
        steps: At this point, "steps" have been obfuscated into conceptual entities, aggregating the underlying notions of "properties" and "true steps". If you need to know a step as it truly exists - such as when recreating Node logic when processing Vendor data - you'll have to use the "realSteps" property below.

    This defines the properties of a "Talent Node Step". When you see a talent node in game, the actual visible properties that you see (its icon, description, the perks and stats it provides) are not provided by the Node itself, but rather by the currently active Step on the node. When a Talent Node is activated, the currently active step's benefits are conferred upon the item and character. The currently active step on talent nodes are determined when an item is first instantiated. Sometimes it is random, sometimes it is more deterministic (particularly when a node has only a single step). Note that, when dealing with Talent Node Steps, you must ensure that you have the latest version of content. stepIndex and nodeStepHash - two ways of identifying the step within a node - are both content version dependent, and thus are subject to change between content updates.

        This model has some attributes which can be filled with additional information found in the manifest (`manifest_...`).
        Without additional work, these attributes will be `None`, since they require additional requests and database lookups.

        - Set `Client.always_return_manifest_information` to `True`, see [here](/API Reference/client)

    Attributes:
        activation_requirement: If the step has requirements for activation (they almost always do, if nothing else than for the Talent Grid's Progression to have reached a certain level), they will be defined here.
        affects_level: If true, this step can affect the level of the item. See DestinyInventoryItemDefintion for more information about item levels and their effect on stats.
        affects_quality: If this is true, the step affects the item's Quality in some way. See DestinyInventoryItemDefinition for more information about the meaning of Quality. I already made a joke about Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance elsewhere in the documentation, so I will avoid doing it again. Oops too late
        can_activate_next_step: There was a time when talent nodes could be activated multiple times, and the effects of subsequent Steps would be compounded on each other, essentially "upgrading" the node. We have moved away from this, but theoretically the capability still exists. I continue to return this in case it is used in the future: if true and this step is the current step in the node, you are allowed to activate the node a second time to receive the benefits of the next step in the node, which will then become the active step.
        damage_type: An enum representing a damage type granted by activating this step, if any.
        damage_type_hash: If the step provides a damage type, this will be the hash identifier used to look up the damage type's DestinyDamageTypeDefinition.
        display_properties: These are the display properties actually used to render the Talent Node. The currently active step's displayProperties are shown.
        interaction_description: If you can interact with this node in some way, this is the localized description of that interaction.
        is_next_step_random: If true, the next step to be chosen is random, and if you're allowed to activate the next step. (if canActivateNextStep = true)
        next_step_index: The stepIndex of the next step in the talent node, or -1 if this is the last step or if the next step to be chosen is random. This doesn't really matter anymore unless canActivateNextStep begins to be used again.
        node_step_hash: The hash of this node step. Unfortunately, while it can be used to uniquely identify the step within a node, it is also content version dependent and should not be relied on without ensuring you have the latest vesion of content.
        perk_hashes: The list of hash identifiers for Perks (DestinySandboxPerkDefinition) that are applied when this step is active. Perks provide a variety of benefits and modifications - examine DestinySandboxPerkDefinition to learn more.
        socket_replacements: If this step is activated, this will be a list of information used to replace socket items with new Plugs. See DestinyInventoryItemDefinition for more information about sockets and plugs.
        start_progression_bar_at_progress: When the Talent Grid's progression reaches this value, the circular "progress bar" that surrounds the talent node should be shown. This also indicates the lower bound of said progress bar, with the upper bound being the progress required to reach activationRequirement.gridLevel. (at some point I should precalculate the upper bound and put it in the definition to save people time)
        stat_hashes: When the step provides stat benefits on the item or character, this is the list of hash identifiers for stats (DestinyStatDefinition) that are provided.
        step_groups: In Destiny 1, the Armory's Perk Filtering was driven by a concept of TalentNodeStepGroups: categorizations of talent nodes based on their functionality. While the Armory isn't a BNet-facing thing for now, and the new Armory will need to account for Sockets rather than Talent Nodes, this categorization capability feels useful enough to still keep around.
        step_index: The index of this step in the list of Steps on the Talent Node. Unfortunately, this is the closest thing we have to an identifier for the Step: steps are not provided a content version agnostic identifier. This means that, when you are dealing with talent nodes, you will need to first ensure that you have the latest version of content.

    Tip: Manifest Information
        This model has some attributes which can be filled with additional information found in the manifest (`manifest_...`).
        Without additional work, these attributes will be `None`, since they require additional requests and database lookups.

        To fill the manifest dependent attributes, either:

        - Run `await ThisClass.fetch_manifest_information()`, see [here](/API Reference/Models/base)
        - Set `Client.always_return_manifest_information` to `True`, see [here](/API Reference/client)

class DestinyItemComponent(BaseModel):
    """
    The base item component, filled with properties that are generally useful to know in any item request or that don't feel worthwhile to put in their own component.

    Tip: Manifest Information
        This model has some attributes which can be filled with additional information found in the manifest (`manifest_...`).
        Without additional work, these attributes will be `None`, since they require additional requests and database lookups.

        To fill the manifest dependent attributes, either:

        - Run `await ThisClass.fetch_manifest_information()`, see [here](/API Reference/Models/base)
        - Set `Client.always_return_manifest_information` to `True`, see [here](/API Reference/client)

    Attributes:
        bind_status: If the item is bound to a location, it will be specified in this enum.
        bucket_hash: The hash identifier for the specific inventory bucket in which the item is located.
        expiration_date: If the item can expire, this is the date at which it will/did expire.
        is_wrapper: If this is true, the object is actually a "wrapper" of the object it's representing. This means that it's not the actual item itself, but rather an item that must be "opened" in game before you have and can use the item.  Wrappers are an evolution of "bundles", which give an easy way to let you preview the contents of what you purchased while still letting you get a refund before you "open" it.
        item_hash: The identifier for the item's definition, which is where most of the useful static information for the item can be found.
        item_instance_id: If the item is instanced, it will have an instance ID. Lack of an instance ID implies that the item has no distinct local qualities aside from stack size.
        item_value_visibility: If available, a list that describes which item values (rewards) should be shown (true) or hidden (false).
        location: An easy reference for where the item is located. Redundant if you got the item from an Inventory, but useful when making detail calls on specific items.
        lockable: If the item can be locked, this will indicate that state.
        metric_hash: The identifier for the currently-selected metric definition, to be displayed on the emblem nameplate.
        metric_objective: The objective progress for the currently-selected metric definition, to be displayed on the emblem nameplate.
        override_style_item_hash: If populated, this is the hash of the item whose icon (and other secondary styles, but *not* the human readable strings) should override whatever icons/styles are on the item being sold. If you don't do this, certain items whose styles are being overridden by socketed items - such as the "Recycle Shader" item - would show whatever their default icon/style is, and it wouldn't be pretty or look accurate.
        quantity: The quantity of the item in this stack. Note that Instanced items cannot stack. If an instanced item, this value will always be 1 (as the stack has exactly one item in it)
        state: A flags enumeration indicating the transient/custom states of the item that affect how it is rendered: whether it's tracked or locked for example, or whether it has a masterwork plug inserted.
        tooltip_notification_indexes: If this is populated, it is a list of indexes into DestinyInventoryItemDefinition.tooltipNotifications for any special tooltip messages that need to be shown for this item.
        transfer_status: If there is a known error state that would cause this item to not be transferable, this Flags enum will indicate all of those error states. Otherwise, it will be 0 (CanTransfer).
        version_number: The version of this item, used to index into the versions list in the item definition quality block.
        manifest_bucket_hash: Manifest information for `bucket_hash`
        manifest_item_hash: Manifest information for `item_hash`

For instance, when Emblems track specific stats, those stats are represented as Objectives on the item.
        objectives: If the item has a hard association with objectives, your progress on them will be defined here.  Objectives are our standard way to describe a series of tasks that have to be completed for a reward.

class DestinyItemInstanceComponent(BaseModel):
    """
    If an item is "instanced", this will contain information about the item's instance that doesn't fit easily into other components. One might say this is the "essential" instance data for the item. Items are instanced if they require information or state that can vary. For instance, weapons are Instanced: they are given a unique identifier, uniquely generated stats, and can have their properties altered. Non-instanced items have none of these things: for instance, Glimmer has no unique properties aside from how much of it you own. You can tell from an item's definition whether it will be instanced or not by looking at the DestinyInventoryItemDefinition's definition.inventory.isInstanceItem property.

        breaker_type_hash: If populated, this is the hash identifier for the item's breaker type. See DestinyBreakerTypeDefinition for more details.
        can_equip: If this is an equippable item, you can check it here. There are permanent as well as transitory reasons why an item might not be able to be equipped: check cannotEquipReason for details.
        cannot_equip_reason: If you cannot equip the item, this is a flags enum that enumerates all of the reasons why you couldn't equip the item. You may need to refine your UI further by using unlockHashesRequiredToEquip and equipRequiredLevel.
        damage_type: If the item has a damage type, this is the item's current damage type.
        damage_type_hash: The current damage type's hash, so you can look up localized info and icons for it.
        energy: IF populated, this item supports Energy mechanics (i.e. Armor 2.0), and these are the current details of its energy type and available capacity to spend energy points.
        equip_required_level: If the item cannot be equipped until you reach a certain level, that level will be reflected here.
        is_equipped: Is the item currently equipped on the given character?
        item_level: The Item's "Level" has the most significant bearing on its stats, such as Light and Power.
        primary_stat: The item stat that we consider to be "primary" for the item. For instance, this would be "Attack" for Weapons or "Defense" for armor.
        quality: The "Quality" of the item has a lesser - but still impactful - bearing on stats like Light and Power.
        unlock_hashes_required_to_equip: Sometimes, there are limitations to equipping that are represented by character-level flags called "unlocks". This is a list of flags that they need in order to equip the item that the character has not met.
